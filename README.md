## Skiing Mod
You like skiing? Now you can do it in minecraft!

##### This mod provides you with:
*   Skis (in all 8 wood types of minecraft vanilla)
*   Ski Sticks (you are much faster when you hold one in your mainhand and one in your offhand)
*   Snow Shovel (break a 3x3 area of snow at once)
*   Chocolate Cup (warm you up with a hot chocolate cup)
*   Dye Pullovers (to keep you warm)
*   Painting (same as the logo)
*   Alps Biome (a better biome to ski)
*   Skis Merchant (a villager that sells skis and other items from that mod, that spawns in a custom villager house)
*   Config (for the skis entity and the snowlayering mechanic)
*   Ski Rack (place down your skis and ski sticks in it)
*   Snow layering mechanic (snow layers are added when it snows and removed when it stops snowing)
